Thorntail PoC
=============

== Build 

The build assumes Docker is present in some cases for deeper integration tests.

You may skip all tests (and its Docker usage) using `-DskipTests`

    mvn clean && mvn install

== Build while running the various TCKs

By default the MicroProfile TCKs are _not_ included in the build.
To include them, simply add `-Ptck` to any `mvn` invocation:

    mvn clean -Ptck && mvn install -Ptck
